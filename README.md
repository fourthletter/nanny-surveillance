# nanny-surveillance

First and foremost, Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue!

**Introduction**
Thank you for visiting the Nanny State of Surveillance project repository. This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the Nanny State of Surveillance.

The use of artificial intelligence or AI in the labor sector has become increasingly more prevalent. Examples include tracking labor productivity, health status, and replacing core job activities among others. AI is simultaneously capturing the employeeâ€™s digital footprint while also predicting their next move. The underpinning AI framework to collect and parse employee data often lack transparency and are largely unregulated. AI technology is shifting the employee and employer relationship, but the design and engineering of those tools could also perpetuate existing structural inequalities. 

Please join us at MozFest 2021 to dismantle these black boxes and help the public reveal what is behind the curtain of these machines.

**Getting Started**
While there are existing legal frameworks for data privacy, labor standards, and consumer rights, these laws are often excluded in the development and design of AI technologies for public consumption. This project will document (1) the prevalence of home surveillance technology in households around Europe and (2) involve nannies, housekeepers, and other domestic laborers in the design of AI technology that is currently driving their industry. I believe domestic workers are experts of their own experiences, and these experiences could inform community-centered solutions to ensure the dignity of laborers. 

**Our Roadmap**

Stakeholders Interviews
Stakeholder Interviews are conversations UX designers conducts with their key stakeholder: workers, potential employers, designers, engineers

Value Proposition
Create a series of cards to help map out the user experience with hiring platforms: what it is, who it is for and how it will be used.

UX Guide
Open source documentation of stakeholder interviews and value proposition excercises.

**Contributing**
The Nanny State of Surveillance project would like your input on how we could increase the transparency of AI design and use in the workplace. Are you a computer scientist with a background on AI? Or are you may be a talented visual artist. Or someone who is good at reminding your team lunch is ready? We welcome your ideas and unique talent, and will not discount anyone's contribution.

Advance knowledge or experience with AI, machine learning, or statistics will contribute to this project by creating models or tests to evaluate public domain tools or reverse engineer proprietary tools.
